# solder

I am fairly new to designing pcbs and i am proud of this s/r latch. I looked at a tutorial and with that knowledge, challenged myself to make it without looking at anything. And I did it! 

An s/r latch is a set/reset latch, powered by 2 cr2032 battery cells. when you power it, on led will turn on. when you click one of the buttons, the other light will turn on and the previous led will turn off, and you alternate buttons ( set/reset ) to turn the other led on.
